# **The API Key Integration Nightmare – Wayfarer’s Challenge**  

Integrating API keys into Wayfarer should have been a seamless process—just plug and play, right?  
**Wrong.**  

### **The Amadeus API Struggle**  
First came **Amadeus API**, the gateway to real-time flight data.  
Authentication hurdles, **token expiration issues**, and **rate limits** turned a simple request into a debugging marathon.  

Despite correct credentials, the API stubbornly threw **401 Unauthorized** errors.  
Bearer tokens required constant refreshing, but something **always broke** the chain.  

### **Weatherstack API Joins the Chaos**  
Then, **Weatherstack API** added fuel to the fire.  
What seemed like a straightforward integration became a battle with:  
- **Inconsistent data responses**  
- **Location mismatches**  
- **Free-tier throttling that left Wayfarer blind to critical weather updates**  

### **The Breaking Point**  
Handling both APIs simultaneously became a logistical nightmare.  
**How do you sync real-time flight updates with ever-changing weather conditions** without overwhelming the system or hitting API limits?  

### **The Solution**  
The answer:  
✅ Smarter request handling  
✅ Caching strategies  
✅ Robust error management  

After relentless debugging and fine-tuning, Wayfarer **finally emerged stronger**—a travel planner that actually delivers.  

**The challenge? Brutal. The result? Wayfarer, redefined.**
